# Introduction to Kubernetes

## Preface

This series of blogs is an introduction to Kubernetes (k8s) explaining its basic concepts and commonly-used components 
for building and deploying applications in Kubernetes. The purpose of this series of blogs is for you quickly learn the basic
knowledge of Kubernetes in an hour. However, I highly recommend you check [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
if you want to dive deeply into Kubernetes.
