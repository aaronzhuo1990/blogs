I recommend you know the basic knowledge Kubernetes Pods before reading this blog. You can check [this doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/ "Pods in Kubernete") for details about Kubernetes Pods.

## What Is A StatefulSet

StatefulSet is a Kubernetes object designed to manage stateful applications. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet scales up a set of pods to the desired number that you define in a config file. Pods in a StatefulSet runs the same containers defined in the `Pod spec` inside the `StatefulSet spec`.  Unlike a Deployment, each Pod of a StatefulSet owns a sticky and stable identity. A StatefulSet also provides the guarantee about ordered deployment, deletion, scaling and rolling updates for its Pods.

## How to Create A StatefulSet
A StatefulSet consists of two components:

- A Headless Service used to control the network ID of the StatefulSet's Pods
- A StatefulSet object used to create and manage its Pods. 

The following example demonstrates how to use a StatefulSet to create a ZooKeeper Server. Please note that the following `StatefulSet Spec` is simplified for demo purpose. You can check [this yaml file](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/statefulsets/zookeeper/zookeeper.yaml "The StatefulSet Configuration for Setting Up A ZooKeeper Service") for the complete StatefulSet configuration of the ZooKeeper Service.

### What Is A ZooKeeper Service

A [Zookeeper service](https://zookeeper.apache.org/ "Zookeeper Service Offical Site") is a distributed coordination system for distributed applications.  It allows to you read, write data and observe data updates. Data is stored and replicated in each ZooKeeper server and these servers groups together as a ZooKeeper Ensemble. The following picture shows the overview of a ZooKeeper service with five ZooKeeper servers. When the ZooKeeper Service starts up, the ensemble holds an election and selects server 1 to be the leader. Then clients can connect to any of these ZooKeeper servers to read/write data once the service is ready. 

![A five-nodes Zookeeper Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronzhuo1990/blogs/master/kubernetes/statefulsets/zookeeper-svc-in-statefulset.jpeg "A five-nodes Zookeeper Service")

Read in ZooKeeper is easy and fast as each server replicates all of the data in its storage. For example, when client 1 connects to server 0 and issues a read request, server 0 directly gets the data from its storage and sends it back to client 1. Write in ZooKeeper, however, is time-consuming and complicated. This is because any write request needs to be processed by the leader. The leader replicates the data write to a quorum and then make the data write visible to all the clients. A quorum (ceil(N/2 + 1)) is the requirement of minimum number of available servers. 
For example, for a five-servers ensemble, at least three servers (5/2 + 1) need to be up at any time.   

**What I want to say here is each server in a ZooKeeper service needs a stable network ID based on the organization requirement. Moreover, one of the ZooKeeper servers needs to be the leader for managing the service topology and processing write requests. StatefulSet is suitable for running such an application as it guarantees uniqueness for Pods.**
  
### Headless Service
A Headless Service is in charge of controlling the network domain for a StatefulSet. The way to create a headless service is to specify `clusterIP == None`. 

The following spec is for creating a Headless Service for the ZooKeeper service. This Headless Service is used to manage [Pod Identify](#### Pod Identify) for the following StatefulSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: zk-hs
  labels:
    app: zk-hs
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 2888
    name: server
  - port: 3888
    name: leader-election
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: zk
```

Unlike a [`ClusterIP` Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types "`ClusterIP` Services in Kubernete") or a [`LoadBalancer` Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer "`LoadBalancer` Services in Kubernetes"), a Headless Service does not provide load-balancing. Based on my experience, any request to `zk-hs.default.svc.cluster.local` is always redirected to the first StatefulSet Pod (`zk-0` in the example).
Therefore, A `ClusterIP` or a `LoadBalancer` Service is required if you need to expose a StatefulSet to the Internet or load-balance traffic for a StatefulSet Pods. 


### StatefulSet Spec

The following spec demonstrates how to use a StatefulSet to run a ZooKeeper service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: zk

# StatefulSet spec
spec:
  serviceName: zk-hs
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: zk # It has to match .spec.template.metadata.labels
  replicas: 5
  podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate

  # volumeClaimTemplates creates a Persistent Volume for each StatefulSet Pods.
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: datadir
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: standard
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi

  # Pod spec
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: zk
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          ...
        podAntiAffinity:
          ...
      # Containers running in each Pod
      containers:
      - name: k8szk
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/k8szk:v3
        ports:
        - containerPort: 2181
          name: client
        - containerPort: 2888
          name: server
        - containerPort: 3888
          name: leader-election
        env:
        ...
        readinessProbe:
          exec:
            command:
            - "zkOk.sh"
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:
          ...
        volumeMounts:
        - name: datadir
          mountPath: /var/lib/zookeeper
```

#### Required Fields

The fields `apiVersion`, `kind` and `metadata` are required as they define metadata of the StatefulSet. `metadata.name` names the StatefulSet and `metadata.labels` adds some labels to the StatefulSet.

The field `spec` is also required as it describes the specification of the StatefulSet. `spec.serviceName` indicates which Headless Service is used to manage network domain for the StatefulSet Pods and `spec.template` defines the pods managed by the StatefulSet. **Like a Deployment, `spec.template` is the boundary between the definition of a StatefulSet and the definition of its Pods.**


#### Pod Selector

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet uses the field `spec.selctor` to find which Pods to manage. You can check [this doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#labelselector-v1-meta "LabelSelector in Kubernetes") for details about the usage of `Pod Selector`.  

#### Replica

The field `spec.replica` specifies the desired number of Pods for the StatefulSet. **It is recommended to run at least two replicas for a StatefulSet in Production, as there is downtime that you cannot avoid in single-Pod StatefulSets.**  This is because of the limitation of the rolling update strategy of StatefulSetsï¼šThe existing Pod needs to be killed before the new one can be created. A single-Pod StatefulSet won't be available for a moment when the old Pod is terminated while the new one is not ready. Therefore, a single-Pod StatefulSet is not able to provide zero downtime guarantee.

**It is also recommended to run an odd number of Pods for some stateful applications like ZooKeepers, based on the consideration of the efficiency of some operations.** For example, a ZooKeeper service marks a data write complete only when more than half of its servers send an acknowledgment back to the leader. Take a six pods ZooKeeper service as an example. The service remains available as long as at least four servers (ceil(6/2 + 1)) are available, which means you service can tolerate the failure of two servers. Nevertheless, it can still tolerate two-servers failure when the server number is lowered down to five. Meanwhile, this also improves write efficiency as now it only needs 3 servers' acknowledgment to complete a write request. Therefore, having the sixth server, in this case, does not give you any additional advantage in terms of write efficiency and server availability.

#### Pod Identify
A StatefulSet Pod is assigned a unique ID, which is also the Pod Name from the Headless Service when it is created. This ID sticks to the Pod during the life cycle of the StatefulSet. The pattern of constructing ID is `${statefulSetName}-${ordinal}`. The example above creates five Pods with five unique IDs `zk-0`, `zk-1`, `zk-2`, `zk-3` and `zk-4`. 

The ID of a StatefulSet Pod is also its hostname. It is also assigned a unique subdomain from the Headless Service. The subdomain takes the form 
`${podID}.${headlessServiceName}.{$namespace}.svc.cluster.local` where `cluster.local` is the cluster domain. For example, the sub domain of the first ZooKeeper Pod is `zk-0.zk-hs.default.svc.cluster.local`. **It is recommended to use sub domain of a Stateful Pod to reach the Pod as it's unique within the whole cluster**

#### podManagementPolicy

You can choose whether to create/update/delete a StatefulSet's Pod in order or in parallel by specifying `spec.podManagementPolicy == OrderedReady` or `spec.podManagementPolicy == Parallel`. `OrderedReady` is the default setting and it controls the Pods to be created
with the order `0, 1, 2, ..., N` and to be deleted with the order `N, N-1, ..., 1, 0`. In addition, it has to wait for the previous Pod to become Ready or terminated prior to terminating or launching the next Pod. `Parallel` launches or terminates all the Pods simultaneously. It does not rely on previous Pod's state to lunch or terminate the next Pod.

#### updateStrategy

There are several rolling update strategies available for StatefulSets. `RollingUpdate` is the default strategy and it deletes and recreates each Pod for a StatefulSet when a rolling update occurs.

Doing rolling updates for applications like ZooKeepers is a little bit tricky: Other Pods need enough time to elect a new leader when the StatefulSet Controller is recreating the leader. **Therefore, You should consider configuring [`readnessProbe`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-readiness-probes "Readiness Probe in Kubernetes") and `readnessProbe.initialDelaySeconds` for the containers inside a StatefulSet Pods to delay the new Pod to be ready, thus delaying the rolling update of the next Pod and giving other running Pods enough time to update the service topology.** This should be able to give your applications, for example, a ZooKeeper service, enough time to handle the case where a server is lost and back.

#### Pod Affinity

**Like a Deployment, the ideal scenario of running a StatefulSet is distribute its Pods to different nodes in different zones and avoid running multiple Pods in the same node.** The field `spec.template.spec.affinity` allows you to specify node affinity and inter-pod affinity (or anti-affinity) for the SatefulSet Pods. You can check [this doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/ "Assigning Pods to Nodes") for details about using node/pod affinity in Kubernetes

#### volumeClaimTemplates

The filed `spec.volumeClaimTemplates` is used to provide stable storage for StatefulSets. As shown in  the following	picture, the field `spec.volumeClaimTemplates` creates a Persistent Volume Claim (`datadir-zk-0`), a Persistent Volume (`pv-0000`), and a 10 GB standard persistent disk for Pod `zk-0`. These storage settings have the same life cycle with the StatefulSet, which means the storage for a Stateful Pod 
is stable and persistent. Any StatefulSet Pod will not lose its data whenever it is terminated and recreated.

## Use Case of StatefulSets

StatefulSets are suitable for running applications which require:
- sticky and unique network ID for the Pods
- Stable and persistent storage for the Pods
- Ordered and automated rolling updates
- Different Pods can execute different tasks. 

You can utilize unique network ID to have different workflow for different Pods within a StatefulSet even though they run the same containers. For example, you can have the following code in a container with a two-replicas StatefulSet called `stateful-set-example`.

```go
if podName == "stateful-set-example-0" {
	// Execute task 0
} else {
	// Execute task 1
}
```

That's it. Thank you for reading this blog.
